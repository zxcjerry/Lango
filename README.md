## How to simulate / run it on iPhone

- Clone the project to local mac. If you have [`git`](https://git-scm.com/) installed, you can do this by executing the following command:

        $ git clone https://github.com/zxcjerry/Lango.git
    
    This will download the repository of samples into the directory
    `Lango`.

- `cd` into this directory in the repository you just cloned, and run the command `./INTALL-COCOAPODS` to prepare all Cocoapods-related dependencies.

-  `open Lango.xcworkspace` to open this project in Xcode. Since we are using Cocoapods, be sure to open the workspace and not Lango.xcodeproj.

- run the simulator of iPhone 8 or plug in an iPhone to download an run
